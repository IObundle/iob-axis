//START_SWREG_TABLE axistream_out 
IOB_SWREG_W(AXISTREAMOUT_IN, 4, 0, 0, 0) //32 bits: Set next FIFO input (Writing to this register pushes the value into the FIFO)
IOB_SWREG_R(AXISTREAMOUT_FULL, 1, 0, -1, 0) //1 bit: Return if FIFO is full
IOB_SWREG_W(AXISTREAMOUT_WSTRB_NEXT_WORD_LAST, 1, 0, -1, 0) //from 1 to 4 bits: Set which output words of the next input word in AXISTREAMOUT_IN are valid and send TLAST signal along with last valid byte. (If this register has value 0, all 4 bytes will be valid and it will not send a TLAST signal with the last byte [MSB]). When the output word width (TDATA) is 8, 16 or 32 bits, this register has size 4, 2 or 1 bits respectively.
